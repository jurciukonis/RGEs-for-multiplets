# Renormalization group equations for the SM with added multiplets

Auxiliary files for the paper "On the addition of a large scalar multiplet to the Standard Model" with computed one-loop RGEs.

- [SARAH](http://sarah.hepforge.org/) model files are available in the folder ["SM+Multiplet"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/tree/main/SM+Multiplet).

- The computed RGEs are available in the folder ["Output"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/blob/main/Output).

- The Mathematica notebook with examples is ["RGEs_for_multiplets.nb"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/blob/main/RGEs_for_multiplets.nb).

- The definitions of the multiplets and the expressions of the RGEs are given in ["Definitions_and_RGEs.pdf"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/blob/main/Definitions_and_RGEs.pdf).

- For more information about the models and obtained results see refs. [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07897)] and [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01628)].
